hello!! i'll greatly appreciate it if you whisper to interact, otherwise i'll likely not notice your message. 
he/him >> other pronouns; i don't really care if you misgender me, but i do prefer he/him. 
c + h freely, i don't mind. but i might not respond or ignore you, my social skills are rather poor. please forgive me if that happens, thank you. 
crowding overwhelms me, i might stop noticing messages entirely. if that happens, i apologize sincerely, please repeat via whisper after it gets less crowded.
do not ask for personal information unless we're friends.
